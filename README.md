# Water-Potability-Analysis
Providing safe drinking water is a basic human right that is essential to the well-being of all individuals. It is also a component of the development and protection of local and national policies. In some areas, the implementation of water supply and sanitation programs can yield a positive economic impact.

For the water quality analysis task, I will be using a Kaggle dataset that contains data on all of the major factors that affect the potability of water. All of the factors that affect water quality are very important,

The pH level is a vital factor that can be used to evaluate the acid-base balance of water. The WHO has recommended that the maximum pH level be set at 6.5 to 8.5. Currently, the investigations range from 6.52 to 6.83.

The primary cause of water hardness is the presence of magnesium and calcium salts. Although it depends on the source, water with a hardness level of 120 to 200 milligrams is considered drinkable.

The ability of water to dissolve various inorganic and organic minerals is a vital factor that can be used to evaluate the quality of water. The total dissolved value (TDS) of water is a measure of its mineral content. It is recommended that the maximum amount of this substance that can be used for drinking is 1,000 mg/l.

In public water systems, chloramines and chlorine are commonly used to kill harmful microorganisms. These chemicals are usually formed by adding ammonia to the water to treat it. Drinking water with concentrations of up to 4 mg/L of chlorine is safe.

Sulfates are substances naturally present in minerals, soil and rocks. In seawater, the concentration of sulfate is around 2,700 to 3,000 mg/L. Sulfates are commonly found in freshwater supplies, though higher concentrations can be found in certain regions. Water containing less than 500 milligrams of sulfate is safe to drink.

Although pure water is not a conductor of electric current, it can improve its electrical conductivity by increasing the concentration of ions. This is because the amount of dissolved substances in the water can determine its electrical conductivity. According to the WHO, the EC value should not exceed 400 S/ cm.

The organic carbon in water comes from either the decaying organic matter found in the ground or from sources that are synthetic. Water containing less than 25 milligrams of organic carbon is considered safe to drink.

THMs are chemicals that can be found in water that has been treated with chlorine. Their concentration can vary depending on the organic matter in the water, how much chlorine is required, and how fast the water is being warmed. At levels of up to 80 parts per million, THMs are considered safe to drink.

The amount of solid matter that's in the suspended state of the water determines its turbidity. This is a measure of the light-emitting properties of the water and is used to determine its quality. A water with a level of less than 5 milligrams of turbidity is regarded as drinkable.
